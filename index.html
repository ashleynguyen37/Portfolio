      <!-- paragraphs about me -->
      <p>
        After graduating high school, I pursued a degree in the health care field. I always wanted to do something that benefits others and my community. As I continued this after college, I understood that it was not the right profession for me and there was something else that would allow me to help others. Soon after I came across software engineering and couldn't be more intrigued.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a couple courses before, and remembered how I enjoyed solving problems that came up as I created something. This pushed me into finding Thinkful and beginning my software engineering journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're looking for an enthusiastic new software developer, please feel free to reach out to me! I love to meet new people and enjoy all the new opportunities to work with others and build something truly amazing!
